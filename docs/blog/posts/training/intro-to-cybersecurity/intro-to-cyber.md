## So, what is it?

Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and information from digital attacks.

Effective cybersecurity measures are designed to counteract these threats by implementing layered defenses and proactive strategies.

## Okay, so what do careers in cybersecurity look like?
